## Automated Testing

### Code quality

##### HTML5

HTML files were passed through this [HTML code validator](https://validator.w3.org/). All files were compliant at the exception of errors related to the use of jinja templating language that is currently not recognized by the code validator. You can see below a screenshot of these recurring errors:

![HTML5 Code Validator Errors](validators/html-errors.png)

##### CSS3

My css file succesfully passed this [CSS code validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

![CSS Code Validator](validators/css3.png)

##### JS

My JS file was passed through [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/), please find below the information provided by the code validator. 

**Metrics:**
- There are 22 functions in this file. 
- Function with the largest signature take 1 arguments, while the median is 0.
- Largest function has 21 statements in it, while the median is 1.
-The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 3 while the median is 1.

**Warnings:**
- Arrow function syntax `=>` is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6').

**1 undefined variable:**
- `swal` (used 4 times for Sweet Alert)

**3 unused variables:**
- `myPrintFunction` (function is invoked when print button is clicked)
- `deleteRecipeFunction`(function is invoked when delete recipe button is clicked)
- `deleteAccountFunction` (function is invoked delete account button is clicked)

![JS Hint](validators/js.png)

##### Python

My [app.py](../app.py) file and [helpers.py](../herlpers.py) were passed through the [PEP8 Online Check](http://pep8online.com/). Both files are PEP8 compliant, I just have one error type (E501) "line too long (84 > 79 characters)" for my app.py. This is due to the fact that some lines in my file exceed 79 characters. I tried to find a way to solve it using a line wrapper to automatically magnify the file but it did not work in my gitpod IDE.

After discussing the issue with my mentor, he confirmed me that there was no problem keeping my file as it is. As long as the file is readable, this is not a common industry practice to keep the number of characters per line < 79 in python files.

## Known Issues

<a name="solved"/>

While testing this project some bugs were discovered and they have been documented in the section down below. 

### Solved Issues

1. Recipe difficulty field (add/edit recipe forms)

While testing the form to add a recipe, I realized that there was no feedback provided to the user if the latter tried to submit the form without selecting a recipe difficulty. 

This is coming from the fact that the `.validate` class used with for `<select>` elements do not properly work with Materialize. As you can see in the picture down below, no feedback was provided for difficulty field while for other fields, they are being underlined in red. 

![Recipe difficulty 1](issues/difficulty1.png)

To solve this issue I decided to manually amend the CSS style according to the input's value. I have not used a data-error/data-success attribute to display a message as for the fields that require direct inputs (like servings etc...) since the value for difficulty is directly picked up and should not have any formatting issues. 

```
$("select#difficulty").change(function(){
    var selectedOption = $(this).children("option:selected").val();
    if (selectedOption == "") {
        $(this).parent(".select-wrapper").children("input").css({"border-bottom": "1px solid #f44336", "box-shadow": "0 1px 0 0 #f44336"});
    } else {
        $(this).parent(".select-wrapper").children("input").css({"border-bottom": "1px solid #4CAF50", "box-shadow": "0 1px 0 0 #4CAF50"});
    };
});
```
I also had to remove the `disabled` attribute that would normally be used as a prompt to select options. This was the only way to correctly display the red border-bottom and therefore make the feedback relevant for users who forgot to update this field. 

`<option value="" selected>Choose Difficulty</option>`

Please see below the resolved bug: 

![Recipe difficulty 2](issues/difficulty2.png)

2. No feedback when user adds new item to ingredient/instruction list (add/edit recipe forms)

I introduced a function to prevent the user from adding a new ingredient if the last ingredient field is empty.

3. Feedback for ingredient/instruction fields (add/edit recipe forms)

Being a direct text input field `<textarea>`, I decided to add a label for this element and to use data-error and data-success attributes to display customized error/validate messages to provide feedback on user inputs. The issue is that this "input field" for ingredients/instructions is a list. So when the user adds new ingredients/instructions to the list, the feedback is provided only for the first field as it is the first element encontered in the DOM with ID ingredients/instructions. I was therefore faced with multiple issues as shown in the screenshots down below:
    - there is no data-error/data-success feedback for each individual field 
    - the content for data-error/data-success appears after the total list (`label::after`) but the feedback only pertains to the first ingredient field

![Ingredient Field 2](issues/ingredient-field-2.png)

![Ingredient Field 1](issues/ingredient-field-1.png)

This created a very confusing feedback for the user and the only way to clear that was to remove the data-error/data-success attributes. The user still gets feedback thanks to the color of the border-bottom for each individual field but I wanted my form to remain harmonized in terms of feedback. 

I have therefore introduced two anonymous functions to provide feedback to the user. Below each ingredient/instruction field I have added an empty div with a class of `.alert-div`. When the user changes the textarea field (with a class of `.manual-feedback`), it will add the class `.data-success-manual` to the `.alert-div` element and shows "validated". If the textarea field remains empty then it will display "*required" in red thanks to `.data-error-manual` class. 

```
function feedbackChangeFunction() {
    $(".manual-feedback").change(function () {
        var field = $(this).val();
        if (field == "") {
            $(this).siblings(".alert-div").removeClass("data-success-manual").addClass("data-error-manual").text("*required");
        } else {
            $(this).siblings(".alert-div").removeClass("data-error-manual").addClass("data-success-manual").text("validated");
        }
    });
}

function feedbackFocusFunction() {
    $(".manual-feedback").focusout(function () {
        var field = $(this).val();
        if (field == "") {
            $(this).siblings(".alert-div").removeClass("data-success-manual").addClass("data-error-manual").text("*required");
        } else {
            $(this).siblings(".alert-div").removeClass("data-error-manual").addClass("data-success-manual").text("validated");
        }
    });
}
feedbackFocusFunction();
feedbackChangeFunction();
```

These two functions where also added the `addIngredientsFunction()` and the `addInstructionsFunction()` as event listeners so the script would also apply to newly added field items!
