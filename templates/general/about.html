    <h4 class="left-align"> Open-free Recipes </h4>
    <p> The pâtisserie journal is an open-free recipes ressource created by two French sisters that were very passionate about pâtisserie and wanted to extend their recipes to any kind of diet!</p>

    <h4 class="center-align"> Personalized Cookbook </h4> 
    <p> Our purpose is to provide patisserie lovers with an intuitive online cookbook tool so that they can easily find new recipes and implement them interactively while cooking. User can share their own recipes by creating/logging to their own account.</p>  
    
    <h4 class="right-align"> Inclusive Project </h4> 
    <p> The purpose of this project is to make patisserie inclusive meaning that anyone with any food allergies, specific types of diet or simply missing an ingredient or a cooking tool would be able to find a suitable recipe. <br> </p>  
    <p> By creating a community that can share their own recipes, it enables to naturally expand the database but also promotes “wannabe” cooks and provide them with visibility. </p>
