# [The Pâtisserie Journal](https://patisserie-cookbook.herokuapp.com)

Welcome!

[The Pâtisserie Journal](https://patisserie-cookbook.herokuapp.com) is an intuitive online cookbook tool to help you find new recipes and implement them interactively while cooking. You can also share your own recipes by creating your own account and join our onlince community!

The purpose of this project is to make patisserie inclusive meaning that anyone with any food allergies, specific types of diet or simply missing an ingredient or a cooking tool would be able to find a suitable recipe. 

By creating a community that can share their own recipes, it enables to naturally expand the database but also promotes “wannabe” cooks and provide them with visibility.

# UX

## User Stories

For this project, I identified the following stakeholders:
-	External users
-	Community members
-	The site owners

### External users

###### User story 1
 
As an external user, I want to make use of the site to share my own data with the community and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members.

###### User story 2

As an external user, I want to be able to research patisserie recipes based on specific criteria and have a visually appealing and interactive interface while I am cooking. 

###### User story 3

As a user with specific constraints (food allergies, specific diets or simply missing a cooking tool…), I want to be able to find recipes that address my needs and be presented recipes based on my inputs.

###### User story 5

Again as a user with specific constraints, I want the site to feature recommendations based on my specific needs (Ex: vegan-friendly, sugar-free…) - TO BE DONE ??

###### User story 6

As a user looking for a specific category of patisserie, I want to be able to look for recipes based on the category of food. 

### Community members

###### User story 1

As a community member, I want to be able to create a free account with minimal steps and then be able to edit my information details, password and delete my account permanently if necessary.

###### User story 2

As a community member, I want to be able to perform CRUD operations for any recipes that I have shared with the community.

###### User story 3

As a community member, I want to be able to share recipes and add some favorites to personalize my intranet and create my own online cooking book. 

###### User story 4

Food lovers, wannabe cooks or anyone passionate about patisserie who wants to try out the success of their recipes.

### Site owners

###### User story 1

Generally speaking we promote a cooking tool and benefit from the collection of the dataset as whole. 

###### User story 2

Be the first member of this community to share her own patisserie recipes!

###### User story 3

Building a full-stack website using Python and mini-framework Flask that allows me to apply my skills in databases handling and interactive design.
