## Testing 

#### User stories

This project has been tested multiple times against each user stories previously listed in the UX section. 

###### Testing user story 1 

*User story: The user has easy access to aggregated data in a simple and clean fashion.*

<u> Hypothesis: </u> For this scenario, the user does not filter using the “start here” modal form. This is simply to test the general purpose of the project.

<u> Test scenario: </u>
-	Go to the home page
-	Scroll down to navigate the dashboard, or,
-	Directly click on the “Exoplanets Dashboard” menu item in the navigation bar to be redirected
-	You should be provided with the source of the data, definition of an exoplanet…
-	You should be able to identify general information regarding the sample: total number of planets in the sample, average stellar year…
-	You should be able to identify through the different graphs relevant information regarding the sample. 

<u> Test result: </u> **Successful**
